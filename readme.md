# HaskMate: Your Haskell Development Companion

![HaskMate Preview](./Images/img.png)

HaskMate is a Haskell-based project monitoring and automation tool, designed to aid Haskell developers in streamlining their workflow. It continuously watches for changes in your Haskell source files and automatically triggers a rebuild and re-execution of the project whenever a modification is detected.

Crafted for simplicity and efficiency, HaskMate keeps an eye on your file modifications, relieving you from the constant back-and-forth manual building process. It allows developers to focus on what matters the most: writing high-quality Haskell code. With built-in support for smart detection and colorful console outputs, HaskMate is more than just a development tool; it's your mate in Haskell development.

Whether you're prototyping a new function, or debugging a complex piece of logic, HaskMate stands by you, ensuring your changes are instantly built and run, providing immediate feedback on your modifications. It's like having a vigilant companion by your side, dedicated to making your Haskell programming experience smoother and more enjoyable.

Embrace the Haskell way with HaskMate!

## Installation and Usage

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure that you have Haskell and Cabal installed on your system. You can download them from the official Haskell website: [https://www.haskell.org/downloads](https://www.haskell.org/downloads).

2. **Clone the Haskmate Repository:**
   - Download the latest version 
   - Click the Green code button
   - CLick Download ZIP

3. **Install Haskmate Dependencies:**
   - Run the following command to install the required dependencies using Cabal:
     ```
     cabal install --only-dependencies
     ```

4. **Build Haskmate:**
   - Once the dependencies are installed, build Haskmate by running the following command:
     ```
     cabal build
     ```

5. **Install Haskmate:**
   - To install Haskmate on your system, execute the install.ps1 in powershell:
     ```
     install.ps1
     ```

6. **Verify the Installation:**
   - After a successful installation, you can check if Haskmate is working by running the following command:
     ```
     haskmate --version
     ```
   - If the installation was successful, it will display the version number of Haskmate.

## Key Features

- **Automatic File Watch**: HaskMate tracks modifications to your Haskell source files in real-time. Once you save a change, it kicks into action.
- **Instant Build and Re-run**: Upon detecting a file modification, HaskMate triggers a rebuild of your project, followed by an execution of the updated build.
- **Smart Detection**: HaskMate employs an efficient change detection mechanism to ensure no unnecessary builds are run.
- **Colored Console Outputs**: Keep track of what's happening through informative, color-coded console outputs.

## Future Plans

- Ability to customize the file watch pattern to include or exclude specific files or directories.
- Integration with popular Haskell test frameworks for automated testing.
